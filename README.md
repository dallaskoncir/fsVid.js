#fsVid - A simple jQuery plugin for full screen background videos with automatically generated poster images

##What is fsVid.js?

fsVid.js is a super lightweight jQuery plugin that will allow you to add a full screen video background to your site easily. Alright, great but why should I use this instead of any of the other plugins out there? On top of the fact that it is lightweight and responsive, I added a little trick that will take the first frame of your video and use that as the poster image. No screenshots! No Extra set up!
